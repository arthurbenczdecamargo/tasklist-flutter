# Task List Flutter
**This project is a task management mobile application built with Flutter.**

## Overview
Task List is a gamified task management app where users can create custom tasks by providing a name, selecting a difficulty level, and adding an image. Each task has its own level that increases as the user interacts with it, supporting ongoing engagement and tracking progress over time. The homepage displays all tasks in a clean, user-friendly layout.

## Features
• **Stack-Based Navigation:** The app uses stack-based navigation to transition between the homepage and task creation form, offering a natural and smooth navigation flow.<br>
• **Task Form Validation:** Ensures all fields are properly filled out before submission, preventing incomplete or invalid tasks.<br>
• **Image Preview:** During task creation, users can provide an image URL and see a live preview, helping with visual identification and personalization.<br>
• **Homepage Task Display:** Displays all created tasks on the homepage in a scrollable list, showing their name, image, difficulty level, and progress.<br>
• **Leveling System:** Users can level up their tasks, providing motivation to increase productivity.<br>
• **State Management:** Efficient state handling ensures tasks are updated in real time across the app.

## Notes
**This project was built as a portfolio app to demonstrate Flutter skills.**
